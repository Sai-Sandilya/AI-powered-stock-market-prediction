# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Package Installation Issues - Solutions

### Problem Summary
Streamlit Cloud has specific requirements and limitations that can cause package installation failures:

1. **Python Version**: Streamlit Cloud uses Python 3.11, not 3.13
2. **Package Compatibility**: Some packages don't work well in the cloud environment
3. **Build Dependencies**: Some packages require compilation which may fail

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Python Version Control
- **`.python-version`**: Specifies Python 3.11.6
- **`runtime.txt`**: Alternative Python version specification
- **`requirements.txt`**: Version constraints compatible with Python 3.11

#### 2. Package Dependencies Fixed

**Core Requirements** (always work):
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0,<2.2.0
numpy>=1.24.0,<1.27.0
yfinance>=0.2.18
plotly>=5.17.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0,<1.4.0
```

**Optional Requirements** (with fallback handling):
```
tensorflow>=2.13.0,<2.16.0  # May fail, code handles gracefully
optuna>=3.4.0               # For hyperparameter tuning
matplotlib>=3.7.0           # For additional visualizations
```

**Excluded Packages** (handled with try/except in code):
- `alpha-vantage` - Optional data source
- `nsepy` - Optional for Indian stocks
- `xgboost`, `lightgbm` - Advanced ML libraries
- `ta-lib` - Requires compilation, replaced with custom functions

#### 3. System Dependencies
**`packages.txt`** for system-level requirements:
```
build-essential
libffi-dev
libssl-dev
python3-dev
pkg-config
```

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Full Requirements (Recommended)
Use the main `requirements.txt` which includes TensorFlow and advanced features.

#### Option 2: Minimal Requirements (Fallback)
If the full requirements fail, rename:
```bash
mv requirements.txt requirements_full.txt
mv requirements_minimal.txt requirements.txt
```

This ensures core functionality works even if advanced ML libraries fail.

### Code Robustness

The application now has improved error handling:

```python
# TensorFlow availability check
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    TENSORFLOW_AVAILABLE = True
    print("‚úÖ TensorFlow is available")
except ImportError as e:
    TENSORFLOW_AVAILABLE = False
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è TensorFlow not available: {e}")
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** with all the new files:
   - `requirements.txt` (updated)
   - `.python-version`
   - `runtime.txt`
   - `packages.txt`

2. **Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Trigger a redeployment
   - Monitor the build logs for any remaining issues

3. **Verify Installation**:
   The app will show status messages for each package:
   - ‚úÖ for successfully loaded packages
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è for optional packages that failed to load

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: TensorFlow Installation Fails
**Solution**: The app will automatically fall back to scikit-learn models only.

#### Issue 2: Build Timeout
**Solution**: Use the minimal requirements.txt which installs faster.

#### Issue 3: Version Conflicts
**Solution**: The version constraints in requirements.txt prevent conflicts.

#### Issue 4: Missing System Dependencies
**Solution**: The packages.txt file installs necessary system libraries.

### Performance Notes

- **Minimal setup**: Loads in ~2-3 minutes
- **Full setup**: May take 5-8 minutes due to TensorFlow
- **Functionality**: Core features work regardless of which packages install

### Testing the Deployment

After deployment, check the logs and verify:

1. ‚úÖ Core packages (streamlit, pandas, numpy, yfinance, plotly, scikit-learn)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional packages may show warnings but app still works
3. üìà Stock data fetching and basic predictions work
4. üîÆ Advanced features may be limited if TensorFlow fails

The app is designed to be resilient - it will work with whatever packages successfully install!
